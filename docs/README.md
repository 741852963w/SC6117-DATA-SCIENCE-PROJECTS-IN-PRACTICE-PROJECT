# VentureProof Docs Website

This documentation site is built with [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).
VentureProof focuses on generating structured venture/industry analysis reports from your brief.

## Prerequisites

To build and preview the documentation locally, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/).
On Windows, you can install via the npm package manager (npm) which comes bundled with Node.js:

```console
npm install --global yarn
```

## Installation

```console
# If your docs include API pages generated by pydoc-markdown, install it:
pip install pydoc-markdown

# Move into the docs site directory (replace if your path differs)
cd docs
yarn install
```

## Local Development

From the docs site directory:

```console
pydoc-markdown
yarn start
```

This starts a local dev server and opens the docs in your browser.
Edits are hot‑reloaded without restarting the server.

Notes
- Product name: VentureProof (formerly GPT Researcher Student Edition in the UI).  
- Frontend app uses a Minimal UI mode by default; docs are independent of the app and can be deployed separately.
